# Clone Wars Game Client Scripts

This repo holds game client scripts for the a Clone Wars Game which can be downloaded here https://alexanderriley.itch.io/clone-wars-game.
If you're interested in running the game server/LAN multiplayer check out that repo here: https://github.com/Jriles/cloneWarsGameServer.

## Notes Regarding This Repo

You will note that the full Unity project for this game client cannot be found here. This is due to the size of the files in the client. 
But I wanted to give anyone interested in the logic of the client a chance to take a look at the code here. This is not my cleanest code, but there are a few things I'm proud of here:
Composition over inheritance, speed of development, mostly DRY constants and performance. If you're interested in the full project, please contact me and I'll see what
I can do to share it with you.

Thanks for checking out my project.
